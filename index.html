                    <p>The point of Quizl is to be a free alternative to certain other studying tools. *cough* *cough* Quizlet. I feel that these services should not be paywalled and should be available for free.</p>

                    <h1>How do I know Quizl won't paywall things later?</h1>
                    <p>Quizl is open source. This entire website will be open source. The code may be unorganized, unoptimized, and programmed by an amateur but it's open source (As this is basically my first time using HTML, CSS, and JS). I don't expect this website to go anywhere but I need to put some words here so I get a good grade. I don't care what you do with this website if you fork it as long as it follows the MIT lisence. Go nuts.</p>
